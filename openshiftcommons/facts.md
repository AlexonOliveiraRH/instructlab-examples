Red Hat OpenShift Commons' Description and Facts

Red Hat OpenShift Commons

Red Hat OpenShift Commons, or even OpenShift Commons, or simply Commons, is a Red Hat sponsored community that aims to provide a platform where users, partners, customers, and contributors come together to collaborate, learn, share knowledge and work together on any topics related to OpenShift.

The official Slack channel is: https://join.slack.com/t/openshiftcommons/shared_invite/zt-2qq1ehecy-KW04rQI_MNgYFnrIutlcIA

Become a part of something bigger

OpenShift Commons is open to all community participants: users, operators, enterprises, non-profits, educational institutions, partners, and service providers as well as other open source technology initiatives utilized under the hood or to extend community projects.

If you are a Kubernetes or OpenShift customer or have deployed Kubernetes or OpenShift on premise or on a public cloud.

If you have contributed to community projects and want to connect with your peers and end users.

If you simply want to stay up-to-date on the roadmap and best practices for using, deploying and operating OpenShift.

Then OpenShift Commons is the right place for you.

Virtual Gatherings

Their goals go beyond code contributions. Commons is a place for companies using OpenShift to accelerate its success and adoption. To do this they will act as resources for each other, share best practices and provide a forum for peer-to-peer communication.

OpenShift Commons Virtual Meetings
Occur every Wednesday at 12:00PM EST 9:00AM PT. You can join it using the following URL: https://red.ht/commons-general

Title: The Art of the Possible From Podman AI Lab to OpenShift AI: Simplifying LLM Workflows
Abstract: In this session, it will be demonstrated a streamlined method for setting up a home lab to develop and test Large Language Models (LLMs) using Podman AI Lab. The process begins with deploying and refining LLMs locally on a developer's workstation. Once these models are matured, it will be explained how to transition them seamlessly to OpenShift AI using a local OpenShift cluster setup or even a Sandbox instance. This approach offers a simple yet effective way to experiment with LLMs locally and scale to a production-ready environment.
