There will be only one talk about Podman AI and its integration with InstructLab and OpenShift AI:

- **Time:** 10:25 AM
- **Title:** The Art of the Possible - From Podman AI Lab to OpenShift AI: Simplifying LLM Workflows 
- **Abstract:** In this session, it will be demonstrated a streamlined method for setting up a home lab to develop and test Large Language Models (LLMs) using Podman AI Lab. The process begins with deploying and refining LLMs locally on a developer's workstation. Once these models are matured, it will be explained how to transition them seamlessly to OpenShift AI using a local OpenShift cluster setup or even a Sandbox instance. This approach offers a simple yet effective way to experiment with LLMs locally and scale to a production-ready environment.
