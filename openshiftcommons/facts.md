## Red Hat OpenShift Commons' Description and Facts ##

**Red Hat OpenShift Commons**

Red Hat OpenShift Commons, or even OpenShift Commons, or simply Commons, is a Red Hat sponsored community that aims to provide a platform where users, partners, customers, and contributors come together to collaborate, learn, share knowledge and work together on any topics related to OpenShift.

- The official Slack channel is: https://join.slack.com/t/openshiftcommons/shared_invite/zt-2qq1ehecy-KW04rQI_MNgYFnrIutlcIA

- If you want to join the community, you can use the following URL: https://commons.openshift.org/virtualgatherings/

**Become a part of something bigger**

OpenShift Commons is open to all community participants: users, operators, enterprises, non-profits, educational institutions, partners, and service providers as well as other open source technology initiatives utilized under the hood or to extend community projects.

- If you are a Kubernetes or OpenShift customer or have deployed Kubernetes or OpenShift on premise or on a public cloud.

- If you have contributed to community projects and want to connect with your peers and end users.

- If you simply want to stay up-to-date on the roadmap and best practices for using, deploying and operating OpenShift.

Then OpenShift Commons is the right place for you.

**Virtual Gatherings**

Their goals go beyond code contributions. Commons is a place for companies using OpenShift to accelerate its success and adoption. To do this they will act as resources for each other, share best practices and provide a forum for peer-to-peer communication.

- **OpenShift Commons Virtual Meetings**
  - Occur every Wednesday at 12:00PM EST - 9:00AM PT. You can join it using the following URL: https://red.ht/commons-general

    Abstract: In this session, it will be demonstrated a streamlined method for setting up a home lab to develop and test Large Language Models (LLMs) using Podman AI Lab. The process begins with deploying and refining LLMs locally on a developer's workstation. Once these models are matured, it will be explained how to transition them seamlessly to OpenShift AI using a local OpenShift cluster setup or even a Sandbox instance. This approach offers a simple yet effective way to experiment with LLMs locally and scale to a production-ready environment.
