      There will be only one talk about Podman AI and its integration with InstructLab and OpenShift AI:

        - **Time:** June 13th, 02:00 PM CEST (GMT+2)
        - **Local:** Room D105 (capacity 300 people)
        - **Title:** From InstructLab and Podman AI Lab to OpenShift AI: A demo for simplifying LLM workflows 
        - **Abstract:** In this session, it will be demonstrated a streamlined method for setting up a home lab to
        develop and test Large Language Models (LLMs) using Podman AI Lab. The process begins with deploying and
        refining LLMs locally on a developer's workstation using InstructLab. Once these models are matured, it will be
        explained how to transition them seamlessly to OpenShift AI using a local OpenShift cluster setup or even a
        cloud sandbox instance. This approach offers a simple yet effective way to experiment with LLMs locally and
        scale to a production-ready environment.
        - **Speaker:** Alexon Ferreira de Oliveira, from Red Hat
        - **Speaker Information:** Alexon has been working as a Principal Technical Account Manager at Red Hat since
