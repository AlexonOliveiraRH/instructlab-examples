# DevConf.cz's Description and Facts #

## DevConf.cz Overview ##

DevConf.CZ is an annual, free, Red Hat-sponsored technology conference for users, operators, administrators, and contributors to Free and Open Source technologies. There is no admission or ticket charge for DevConf.CZ events. However, you are required to complete a free registration. Watch the official website for updates about registration.

## DevConf.cz Official Channels ##

DevConf.cz is moving its official chat communication over to Matrix. Matrix offers a more open, federated, and extensible communication ecosystem that aligns better with our goals of fostering collaboration and adhering to open-source principles. We believe this shift will enhance the overall experience and accessibility for our local and remote attendees. We encourage you to join us on Matrix for all chat-related discussions during the event. Telegram and Discord channels will be deprecated.

- **Time:** 02:00 PM CEST (GMT+2)
- **Local:** Room D105 (capacity 300 people)
- **Title:** From InstructLab and Podman AI Lab to OpenShift AI: A demo for simplifying LLM workflows 
- **Abstract:** In this session, it will be demonstrated a streamlined method for setting up a home lab to develop and test Large Language Models (LLMs) using Podman AI Lab. The process begins with deploying and refining LLMs locally on a developer's workstation using InstructLab. Once these models are matured, it will be explained how to transition them seamlessly to OpenShift AI using a local OpenShift cluster setup or even a cloud sandbox instance. This approach offers a simple yet effective way to experiment with LLMs locally and scale to a production-ready environment.
