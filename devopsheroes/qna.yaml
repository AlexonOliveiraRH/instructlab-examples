      Time: 10:00 AM
      Title: Democratizing LLMs with InstructLab
      Abstract: In this session, we’ll explore how to use InstructLab on a community Linux distribution.
      The InstructLab project tackles the challenges of working with large language models (LLMs), such as the need
      for high-quality training data, specialized expertise, and extensive computational resources, by offering an
      open-source approach to generative AI. By leveraging community contributions, InstructLab enables regular
      builds of improved LLM versions with the goal of reducing costs, removing barriers to testing and
      experimentation, and enhancing alignment to ensure model outputs are accurate, unbiased, and consistent with
      the values and objectives of its users and creators.
