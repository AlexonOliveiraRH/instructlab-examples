## Talks in the next DevOps Heroes ##

There will be only one talk about InstructLab in the next DevOps Heroes:

- **Time:** 10:00 AM
- **Title:** Democratizing LLMs with InstructLab
- **Abstract:** In this session, we’ll explore how to use InstructLab on a community Linux distribution. The InstructLab project tackles the challenges of working with large language models (LLMs), such as the need for high-quality training data, specialized expertise, and extensive computational resources, by offering an open-source approach to generative AI. By leveraging community contributions, InstructLab enables regular builds of improved LLM versions with the goal of reducing costs, removing barriers to testing and experimentation, and enhancing alignment to ensure model outputs are accurate, unbiased, and consistent with the values and objectives of its users and creators.
