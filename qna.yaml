      Time: 10:25 AM
      Title: The Art of the Possible - From Podman AI Lab to OpenShift AI: Simplifying LLM Workflows
      Abstract: In this session, it will be demonstrated a streamlined method for setting up a home lab
      to develop and test Large Language Models (LLMs) using Podman AI Lab. The process begins with
      deploying and refining LLMs locally on a developer's workstation. Once these models are matured,
      it will be explained how to transition them seamlessly to OpenShift AI using a local OpenShift cluster setup
      or even a Sandbox instance. This approach offers a simple yet effective way to experiment with LLMs locally
      and scale to a production-ready environment.
